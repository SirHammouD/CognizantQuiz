# CognizantQuiz

# Desc:
A small quiz game that usess a json file to provide data. 
The data gets pulled and filtered then passed through into a recyclerview using a data model tailored to it.
If next is clicked, the UI updates into the next question, goes through all 5 of them and then back to the firstone when end is reached.
If the correct answer is pressed, a "Success" Toast is shown, else a "Fail" Toast is presented.

# Note:
The only thing that was added to the project after we ended our session was the json file reading and the answer selection process.Â
